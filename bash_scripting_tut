What is shell?
A unix shell program interprets user commands which are entered directly or read from a file called shell file or shell scripts. They are interpreted by the OS and they need not be compiled for execution.

Different types of shells -> We are learning Bash shell scripting.

Different types of shell support
-> cat /etc/shells

Bash stands for Born Again SHell. Its standard GNU shell. Intuitive, used in Linux/Unix OS.

Where BASH is located?
-> which bash

Creating first shell script : Not necessary to add .sh extension. But if you are going to use an editor to open it, it's useful. It'll render it.
Use touch to create the file.

Use "ls -al" to display read-write permissions for You, for group and for user.

#! /bin/bash -> Used to tell that it is a bash shell script

We currently have only read-write permission, not execute permission. Use chmod +x hello.sh to make it executable

Now ./hello.sh to run the script.

In a UNIX shell, there are two types of variables: System variables(predefined, by OS. In capital cases) and User defined variables(generally in lower cases). 

Use -p in read -p to read in the same line
Whenever you write read without a variable following it, it gets stored in a built in variable REPLY. Use echo $REPLY.

name=vasu
echo $name -> outputs vasu
echo "$name" -> same
echo '$name' -> outputs $name

If else condition->

if [ condition ]
then
	statement
fi

If using [] for condition
-eq for equality (-ne  )
-gt for greater than (-lt)
-ge for greater than equal to(-le)

Otherwise use (( condition )) instead of square brackets for >, >=, ==, != etc with numbers or [[ condition ]] incase of strings.

There are two types of files: One is block special file(video, music, image files) and other is character special file(contains normal text).

Use ls -l to see information about files in pwd.
-r, -w, -x flags for checking readable, writtable, executable flags respectively.
